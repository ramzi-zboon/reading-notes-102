Learn Markdown
What I learned today is the following:

Markdown: An easy way to design text on the web and its markup language is much lightweight and fast than other languages.

What I learned from this beautiful viewing is that GitHub helps build all sorts of cool things and lets you convert GitHub repositories into web sites consistent with your business or project, base pages that even need HTML knowledge. Use the (**, __) effects for the star line (*) for bold and (_) for italic. Good evening everyone:
